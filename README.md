# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

This project uses RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses understand their customers better and target each segment with tailored marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

Using historical transaction data, I performed data cleaning, calculated RFM scores, and applied K-means clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments. Each segment received personalized recommendations for engagement and retention.

## Key Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, focusing on relevant columns and handling canceled transactions.
2. RFM Calculation: Created Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
3. Customer Segmentation: Used K-means clustering to group customers into actionable segments.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Provided specific marketing strategies for each segment.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For data processing and analysis
- Pandas: Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn: Clustering
- Matplotlib: Visualization

## Results

The segmentation identified three main customer groups:

- High-value customers: Recommended for loyalty programs and exclusive offers.
- Regular customers: Encouraged with promotional offers to increase engagement.
- Low-value or infrequent customers: Targeted with re-engagement campaigns.
